# Reflection
  One of the main hurdles was deciding how to organize and present my work in a way that was both visually appealing and easy to navigate. To solve this, I looked at several professional portfolios for inspiration and created wireframes before building out the structure. I also faced technical issues like responsive design inconsistencies across devices. I used browser developer tools and testing across multiple screen sizes to fine-tune the layout. Time management was another challenge. Balancing this project with other responsibilities was tough, so I broke the work into smaller, manageable tasks and tracked progress with a checklist. Next, I’d like to enhance the interactivity of the site—adding animations or a dark/light theme toggle. I’d also like to optimize the content by rewriting project descriptions to focus more on problem-solving and impact. Finally, gathering feedback from peers or mentors earlier in the process would help me identify areas for improvement that I might have missed. Overall, building this portfolio was a valuable learning experience that helped sharpen both my technical and design skills.
